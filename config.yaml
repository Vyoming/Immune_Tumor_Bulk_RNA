# path  to sequencing sample sheet:
#   * TSV format
#   * required columns: sample, condition, unit, fq1, fq2
#   * optional: strandedness; other design columns for differential expression
#               analysis
# Column description:
#   * sample: name of sample to analyse
#   * condition: column to use for differerntial expression analysis, indicating
#    for instance, if sample is "control" or "treatment"
#    * units are technical replicates e.g. lanes, or sequencing of the
#    same library/sample)
#    * strandedness: indicates if and which type of stranded library protocol was
#    used; possible values: empty, none, yes or reverse. none  for unstranded
#    protocols, yes an reverse follow the nomenclature used in
#    `htseq-count --reverse` which is referenced in STAR manual section 7,
#    "Counting number of reads per gene".
